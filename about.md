I am a software engineer from Brazil/USA going around the world and aspiring to be the best I can be. This is the place I use for sharing thoughts, learnings and giving back to the internet community the most I can from the little I know. I don't write that often, however!

In my current day job I write software for [Checkr](https://checkr.com/). I help both shape the direction and transform the business' needs into reliable, resilient and well-tested clean software.

I currently live in Seattle, Washington, USA and always looking for a new place to explore.

Everything shared here are my personal views and don't represet opinions of anyone else but me.
