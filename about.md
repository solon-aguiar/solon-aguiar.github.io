I am a software engineer from Brazil going around the world and aspiring to be the best I can be. This is the place I use for sharing thoughts, learnings and giving back to the internet community the most I can from the little I know.

In my day job I write software for Amazon.com. I help transform the business needs and ideas into reliable, resilient and well-tested clean software.

I am currently in Seattle, Washigton, USA and always looking for a new place to explore.
