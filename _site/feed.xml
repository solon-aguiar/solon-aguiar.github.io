It is built on jekyll and hosted on github pages. It is a simple yet powerful and extensible set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to use it as a way to share some of my personal thoughts and whatever interesting topics (in my field of work or not) I feel good about writing.
You shouldn’t expect scheduled updates. Even though I plan to be dilligent about writing, I won’t just write for the sake of writing, so updates will come as I find interesting things to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first series I plan on writing about is about patterns for reliable backend systems (or microservices). Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is my new website. It is built on jekyll and hosted on github pages.
