excerpt: A legacy software -> CD story

A post that I wrote on the Checkr engineering blog about getting legacy software to CD. Check it out <a href="https://medium.com/checkr/from-legacy-to-continuous-deployment-1d25f0317e8c" target="blank">here!</a>

The blog post was also became a presentation that I delivered on AgileAus23 (more about it in the [Talks](/talks/) page).
